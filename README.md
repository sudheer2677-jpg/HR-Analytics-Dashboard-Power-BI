HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI + Python Project

This project analyzes an HR dataset to identify employee attrition trends, workforce distribution, and performance insights using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization.

What I did:

Collected a real HR dataset from Kaggle.

Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python (Pandas):

Removed duplicates

Treated missing values

Fixed incorrect data types

Handled outliers

Exported the cleaned dataset into Power BI for modelling.

Built an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI with KPIs such as:

Attrition Rate

Employee Count

Hiring & Attrition Trends

Employee Performance Metrics

Applied DAX measures for calculations such as attrition rate, average age, job satisfaction score, and salary analysis.

Added interactive slicers for filtering by:

Department

Delivered insights into attrition patterns and supported HR decision-making by improving reporting efficiency and trend visibility.
